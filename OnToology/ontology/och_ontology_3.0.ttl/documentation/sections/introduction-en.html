    Ontologies have emerged in the last two decades as a powerful mechanism for representing and integrating data on the web. An ontology explicitly specifies a shared conceptualization to describe top-level and domain knowledge for various tasks [1]. Ontologies can be represented in multiple forms using visual editors, UML-based tools, etc. But they are usually implemented using declarative and formal languages such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL), a W3C recommendation [2]. Like any other engineering artefact, ontologies evolve and suffer changes during their lifecycle [3,4]. In this context, change representation is a challenging task [5]; there can be several levels of representation depending on the granularity of said changes, the ontology language being considered, the specific requirements of a project, etc. [6,7]. Recording these modifications in a consistent, machine-readable format will enhance ontology engineering practices and make ontologies more reusable in developments driven by knowledge graphs. With that in mind, we present the OWL Change Ontology (OCH), an ontology to represent OWL ontology changes in RDF. Following Linked Open Terms methodology (LOT) [8], we provide a detailed and domain-independent approach to describe the changelogs of any OWL ontology. The ontology is openly available, both the code and the documentation. During the development, we focused on the ontologyâ€™s adaptability, reusability and extendibility when modelling changes. OCH aims to fill an essential gap in ontology engineering methodologies and facilitate ontology developers in the maintenance of their vocabularies.
